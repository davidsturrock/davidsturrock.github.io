  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My career as a robotics engineer started while studying my MSc in Electrical Engineering at the University of Cape Town. My task was to design and implement an autonomous navigation system on a robotic rover. 
  Working under Dr Paul Amayo - DPhil at Oxford and a previous Oxbotica perception engineer - I helped set up a new robot, a Clearpath Husky.</p>
  
  <p>I quickly familiarised myself with ROS and Linux and a sensor suite including a stereo camera and LIDAR. 
  I developed and tested a simple teach and repeat algorithm using a stereo camera, enabling the Husky robot to navigate along a previously piloted route.</p>
  
  <p>I adapted and trained a General Adversarial Network (GAN) to predict human trajectories and plan a viable and socially compliant trajectory for the robot to navigate given a desired goal state. And finally, I implemented a navigation system on the robot that could execute the networkâ€™s planned trajectory.
  My work covered visual odometry and camera based localisation in outdoor farm environments. I investigated SLAM algorithms such as ORB SLAM and AMCL. I worked on object tracking using LIDAR. Simulation work was done in Gazebo. Machine learning work was done on a high performance computer cluster at the university.</p>
  
  <p>In a small team of 3 masters students and our supervisor, Dr Amayo, the workload and scope of responsibilities was intense. As a result I am comfortable with intense pressure, self-taught learning, and problem-solving issues that fall anywhere between software and hardware.</p> 

  <p>Since finishing my masters in February of 2023, I have continued my work under Dr Amayo, acting now as a research engineer. I help maintain and develop a C++ code base that covers state estimation, mapping and reconstruction, and localisation. I believe it is time for me to branch out into industry to continue to challenge myself and to contribute to the development of robotics. I believe working at Wayve would be the perfect opportunity to do this.
